# RGB realtime led Power (KilloWatt/Hour) Indicator

## What does it do?
First of all you need a smart power meter in your home. The system reads the current power used in your home an translates it into a RGB colour.
So for example we can set the colour according to the used Kilowatts. for example under 500 watts the led will be green, from 500 to 1500 watts it will be yello and all above will be red. in beween the colours are faded into eachother to get a smoother effect.
We use Wifi Leds from MI Light

## What do we need?
